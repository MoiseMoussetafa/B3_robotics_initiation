# KINEMATICS Program

kinematics.py 
- Direct Kinematics : with tests angles of Theta1, Theta2, Theta3 and obtain positions X, Y, Z of P3
- Inverse Kinematics : with tests positions of P3, obtain Theta1, Theta2, Theta3

ondemand_kinematics.py permits to obtain ouputs with custom inputs, in DK or IK.
