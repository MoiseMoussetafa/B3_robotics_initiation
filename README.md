# KINEMATICS Programs

kinematics.py 
- Direct Kinematics : with tests angles of Theta1, Theta2, Theta3 and obtain positions X, Y, Z of P3
- Inverse Kinematics : with tests positions of P3, obtain Theta1, Theta2, Theta3

ondemand_kinematics.py permits to obtain ouputs with custom inputs, in DK or IK.

## Launch the program kinematics.py :
- Download/open the code from the git
- In the terminal : python3 kinematics.py
The program gives the results directly on 8 tests in the terminal, 4 direct and 4 inverse
